1. data collection - cpcb
2. data preprocessing - 
	identifying missing values
	replacing string values with nan
	filling missing values with mean of each column
	averaging 'min' and 'max' columns into  new single parameter column
	fitting the data values into weighted rating cycle
3.calculated wqi using rating scale values and weights with respective parameters
4.applying both classification and regression models on preprocessed data
  -classification
	+ feature selection pipeline
  	+ splitting dataset into train and test 
	+ applying smote
5. -predicting wqi value using regression model
   - classifying the dataset into potable and non-potable water
6.Model evaluation
